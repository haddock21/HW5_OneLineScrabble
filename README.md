Write up:
This project implements a simplified Scrabble game with drag-and-drop 
functionality using jQuery and jQuery UI. It dynamically populates a tile rack 
with random Scrabble tiles, tracks their positions on the board, and updates the 
current word and score in real-time. It supports special tiles such as blank tiles 
that can be assigned a letter through a dialog box. The file handles scoring with 
letter and word multipliers, validates words for consecutive letters, and updates 
the rack with new tiles after word submission. The game also includes functionality 
to recall tiles to the rack, reset the game, and swap tiles if placed on top of each 
other.
